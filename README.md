# Web-World
Web World, virtual machine.

Web World is a virtual machine designed to simulate real-world web application vulnerabilities. 

This machine is created with the goal of allowing individuals to learn and practice their penetration testing skills, with a focus on common security vulnerabilities found in web applications.  

By exploiting these vulnerabilities, the goal is to gain root access, which would give the attacker full control over the virtual machine. 

This can help individuals to understand the techniques and methods used by attackers in the real world and equip them with the necessary knowledge to secure their own systems.  

This virtual machine is suitable for individuals who are interested in learning about web application security, as well as experienced penetration testers who want to sharpen their skills and test their knowledge. 

With a realistic representation of common vulnerabilities, Web World provides a safe and controlled environment for learning and experimentation.
